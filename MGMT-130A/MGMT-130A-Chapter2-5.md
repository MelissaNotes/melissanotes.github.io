## Balance sheet (Point of time)
**Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder’s Equity**

* Fixed Assets:

   1. Tangible, `EX: Property, Plants and Equipment`;

	 2. Intangible: `EX: copyrights goodwill`.     

* Current Liability

   * Account Payable: `trade/buy things from vender`;

   * Notes Payable: financial debt shorter than one year, `EX: loan less than one year, commercial paper`;


* Shareholders Equity, `EX. Retained Earnings, money from stock issued`.     


### Liquidity     

Ease and quickness with which assets can be converted to cash.

* own Liquid Assets, can sell immediately without losing its value, `EX. Cash, Treasury Bill in low risk market.`

* The more liquid assets, with in certain amount of time, more ability to pay all bills.

* Down side with too much liquid assets: lower return.

`Notes: current assets is a proxi but not same`     

### Leverage     

How much debt and Equity     

* Being Leverage = using more debt = More risky to be bankrupt = Increase rate of return

* Debt to Equity ratio measures leverags: $\frac {Debts}{Equity} = \frac{Total~Liability}{Total~Shareholders Equity}$

### Book Value Vs. Market Value     

Book value work with depreciation

## Income Statement (Period of time)     

**Revenue - Expenses = Income**

* Revenue is recognized when earned.

   * transaction takes place &rarr; Account receivable created &rarr; revenue recognized

   * payed by customer ahead &rarr; Account Payable created &rarr; will pay back later but recognized.

## Tax
* Marginal: Next dollar rate

* Average $= \frac {Total~tax}{Total~income}$

* Example: One earned $250,000 in taxable income:

Rate | Bracket Size | Pay in Bracket | Left to Pay
---| ---| ---| ---|
-|-|-|250,000
15%|50,000|50,000|200,000
25%|25000|25000|175,000
34%|25000|25000|150,000
39%|235,000|150,000|-
Total tax = 80,750, Marginal Tax Rate 39%, Average Tax Rate = 32.3%

## Cash Flow     

* Total Cash from **Operating** cash flow (**OCF**) measures cash generated from operations not counting capital spending or working capital requirements.     

   * OCF = EBIT + Depreciation (because it is not cash exp.) - Taxes;     

   * OCF = NI + Depreciation - Change in other current assets + Changes in Current Liability;     

* Total Cash from **Investing** = -Change in Net Fixed Asset - depreciation     

* Total Cash from **Financing** Activities = Change in cash -Total Cash form Operation + Total Cash from Investing     

  * BEG Cash + Total Cash form Operation + Total Cash from Investing +Total Cash from Financing Activities = END Cash     

## Free Cash Flow     

* Cash flow received from the firm’s assets must equal the cash flows to the firm’s creditors and stockholders:      

   * CF(Assets)≡ CF(Bondholders) + CF(Shareholders)     

   * CF(Assets)≡ OCF-Change in Net Working Capital - Net Capital Spending     

   * Creditor - Debt (Interest)     
   CF(Creditors)=INT EXP - LT Debt

   * Stockholders - Equity (Dividends)     
   CF(Shareholders)= Div + Company Redeemed

   * Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liability

   * Change in Net Working Capital = Current Net Working Capital - Prior Net Working Capital

   * Net Capital Spending = Net Fixed Asset Increased + Depreciation

## Book Ratios
### Liquidity Ratios     

* Current ratio = $\frac {current~~assets}{current~~liabilities}$     

   * if current ratio is $1.3, that means the company has $1.3 in current assets for every $1 in current liabilities, or it has its current liabilities covered 1.31 times over.     

   * We expect a current ratio of at least 1.     

   * a current ratio of less than 1 would mean that net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) is negative.     

* Quick ratio (Acid-test) = $\frac {Current~~Assets - Inventory}{Current~~Liabilities}$      

* Cash Ratio = $\frac {Cash}{Current~~Liabilities}$     

### Leverage Ratios (Long term/ Solvency Ratios)     

* Total Debt Ratio = $\frac{Total~~Assets - Total~~Equity}{Total~~Asset}$     

   * larger has more leverage.     

   * if total debt ratio is 0.28, for every $1 in assets, the company has \$0.28 in debt, therefore \$0.72 in equity.

* Debt/Equity ratio = $\frac{Total~Debt}{Total~Equity}$ = $\frac{Total~Debt ~Ratio}{1-Total~Debt~Ratio}$     

* Equity Multiplier = $\frac {Total~~Assets}{Total~~Equity} = 1+$ Debt/Equity ratio     

### Coverage Ratios      

* Times Interest Earned = $\frac{EBIT}{Interest}$     

* Cash Coverage = $\frac{EBIT+Depreciation+Amortization}{Interest}$     

### Inventory Ratios     

* Inventory Turnover = $\frac{Cost~~of~~Good~~Sold}{Inventory}$     

   * Measures how many times you turnover the inventory in a year.     

   * The higher, more efficiently to manage the Inventory.     

* Days' Sales in inventory = $\frac{365}{inventory~~turnover}$     

   * how long the good sits in the inventory before it is sold.       

   * if Days' Sale in inventory is 100, it means inventory sits 100 days on average before it is sold.     


### Receivables Ratios     

* Receivables Turnover = $\frac{Sales}{Account~~Receivables}$     

   * use credit sale if possible, use ending balance receivables or average of beg and end.

   * if RT is 12 times, means we collect money and lend again 12 times a year.     

* Days' sales in receivable (Average collet credit)= $\frac{365}{Receivables~~turnover}$      

   * how fast we collect sales      

### Cash Conversion Cycle     

* Cash Cycle = inventory period + accounts receivable period - account payable period     

* the smaller, the better. if negative, meaning the company receive the money from sales earlier than they need to pay the inventory.     

### Total Asset Turnover     

* Total Asset Turnover = $\frac {Sales}{Total~~Assets}$     

   * not usual if <1

### Profitability Measures     

#### Profit Margin     

* Gross Profit Margin = $\frac {Sales - COGS}{Sales}$          

   * GPM is 23%, meaning every dollar in sale,  the company keep $0.23 as net income.     

   * the higher, more profitable for the company.     

* Operating Profit Margin = $\frac {EBIT}{Sales}$     

* Profit Margin= $\frac{Net Income}{Sales}$     

   * higher better.     
   * if PM is 30%, meaning

#### ROA & ROE     

* ROA(Return on Assets or Return on investment) = $\frac{Net~Income}{Total~Assets}$     

* ROE(Return on Equity) = $\frac{Net~~Income}{Total~~Equity}$


## Market Value Measures     

* Market Capitalization = price per share * shares outstanding     

   * Value of the **equity** of the firm.     


* PE Ratio = $\frac {Price~per~share}{Earning~per~share}$     

   * what the market think the future of the firm, how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current earnings.     

   * higher PEs means firm has more significant prospects for future growth.     


* Market-to-Book ratio= $\frac {market~value~per~share~of~Equity }{book~value~per~share~of~Equity}$     

* Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Capitalization + Market value of Interest bearing debt - Cash.

* EV Multiple = $\frac{EV}{EBITDA}$     


### DuPont Identity
$ROE = \frac{Net ~ Income}{Total~Equity}$     

$ROE = \frac{Net~Income}{Total~Assets} \frac{Total~Assets}{Total~Equity} =$ ROA × Equity Multiplier;     

$ROE = \frac{Net~Income}{Total~Assets} \frac{Total~Assets}{Total~Equity} \frac{Sales}{Sales}$ &rarr; $ROE = \frac{Net~Income}{Sales} \frac{Sales}{Total~Assets} \frac{Total~Assets}{Total Equity}$     

ROE = Profit Margin × Total Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier.

## Pro Forma Statements     
Set up projected financials Statements.     

* profit margin is constant.     

After 20% growth in sale,Income statement Sale increase 20%(\$1,000 × 120\%), Costs are projected by profit margin ($\frac{\$800}{\$1,000} × $1,200$).     

But Pro Forma Balance Sheet have different ways to changes based on financial decision the company will make.      

1. Net Income \$240 is retained, to Equity increse \$240, to balance out with Assets, Debt has to be retired to \$110.     

2. Only \$50 from net income goes to Equity, the rest \$190 pay dividends, issued new debt.      

### Assets, liability and Equity     

* Assume all assets, including fixed, vary directly with sales.     

* Accounts payable normally vary directly with sales.     

* Notes payable, long-term debt, and equity generally do not vary with sales because they depend on management decisions about capital structure.     

* The change in the retained earnings portion of equity will come from the dividend decision.     

### Dividend     

* Dividend Pay Out Ratio = $\frac{Cash~Dividend}{Net~Income}$

* Retention Ratio or Plowback Ratio = $\frac{Addition~to~Retained~Earnings}{Net~Income} = 1-$ dividend pay out ratio.      

### External Financing Needed (EFN)     

External Financing Needed (EFN) is the difference between the forecasted increase in assets and the forecasted increase in liabilities and equity.    

EFN = (Projected year) Total Asset - Total liabilities owner's equity.     

If LT debt and equity do not change:     
EFN = growth in assets - growth in account payable - additions to retained earnings      
$=$  Old Assets $×$ growth rate $-$ Old Account Payable $×$ growth rate $-$ Old Net Income $× (1+$ growth rate $)× (1 -$ payout rate)


EFN $= \frac{Assets}{Sales} × △Sales - \frac{Liability}{Sales} × △Sales - (PM × Projected Sales) × (1 - d), ~d$ is Dividend Ratio, $1-d$ is Retention ratio.     

### Internal growth rate    

How much the firm can grow assets using retained earnings as the only source of financing.     

IGA= $\frac{ROA × b}{1-ROA×b}, ~ where ~ b$ is the Retention Ratio.     

### Sustainable growth rate     

How much the firm can grow by using internally generated funds and issuing debt to maintain a constant debt-to-equity ratio.

g = $\frac{ROE × b}{1-ROE × b}, ~ where ~ b$ is the Retention Ratio.

## Discounting and Compounding     

### One Period Case     

* $FV = C_0 × (1 + r)$     
`r is the rate per period, year in this case.`

* $PV = \frac{C_T}{1+r}$     

* $NPV =~ –~ Cost + PV$     
`positive NPV` &rarr; `positive investment.`     

### Multi-Period Case
Compounding: Interest applies to the principle and interests  from previous period     

* $FV = C_0 × (1+r)^T$     

* Compounding adds up faster than Simple Interest.     

* $PV = \frac {C_T}{(1+r)^T}$     

## Excel Function     
* Future Value: FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv])      

* Present Value: PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv])     

* Number of Periods: NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv])     

* Required Rate: RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv])     

`if use cell to represent anything in the formula:`, `A1` will change to relative cell, `$A$1` will not change the cell when drag the format.       

## Compounding Periods     

* $FV = C_0 × (1+\frac{r}{m})^{m×T}$     
`r is the rate per periods, m is the numbers of periods in a year, T is the total years of investment`     

* Example:  $PV~=~50, ~T~=~3~years, ~rate~=~12%$ compounded semi-annually: $FV = \$50 × (1 + \frac{12\%}{2})^{2×3}$     

* Continuous Compounding: $lim~FV = C_0 × (1+\frac{r}{m})^{m×T} = e^{rT}$     

* Discounting: $PV = FV × (1+\frac{r}{m})^{-~mT}$      

* Continuous Discounting: $PV = e^{-~rT}$     

## Effective Annual Rate     
* In previous example: $FV = \$50 × (1 + \frac{12\%}{2})^{2×3} = \$70.93$     
this is equal to $\$50 × (1+EAR)^3 = \$70.92$   

* Solve for EAR : $\frac{FV}{PV}^{\frac{1}{T}} -1$  

## Repeated periods

### Perpetuity     

A constant Payment, starts next period, lasts forever, interest rate $r$:

$PV = \frac{C}{1+r} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^3} +~... = \frac{C}{r}$     

### Growing Perpetuity
A Growing Payment at rate $g$, starts next period, lasts forever, interest rate $r$:     

discount rate > growth rate     

$PV = \frac{C}{1+r} + \frac{C×(1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{C×(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3} +~... = \frac{C}{r-g}$      

#### Growing Perpetuity with first payment now     
starting as the second payment, fit with Growing Perpetuity, $C =$ second payment, calculate the PV then $+$ the current payment value.      

### Annuity     

A constant payment, fixed maturity, fixed rate:     

$PV = \frac{C}{1+r} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + ... +\frac{C}{(1+r)^T} = \frac{C}{r}[1- \frac{1}{(1+r)^T}]$     

### Growing Annuity     

$PV = \frac{C}{1+r} + \frac{C×(1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{C×(1+g)^{T-1}}{(1+r)^T} = \frac{C}{r-g}[1- (\frac{1+g}{1+r})^T]$       

## Loan Amortization     

### Pure Discount Loan:
Pay principle and interest once in some future date.     

### Interest Only Loan:
Every period same interest payment : principle * interest rate     
last period with additional payment of the principle.     

### Fixed principle payment:     
Every period pay constant amount of principle, the interest will be different because for every interest incurred period, outstanding loan balance is decreasing. Total payment is decreasing.     

### Fixed total payment:
Total payment for each period is same, the portion of principle is increasing, the portion of interest is decreasing.     

When given the loan amount, rate, total periods, then we can calculate the fixed payment for each period.      
the first payment contains interest: total loan * int rate, and and portion of principle : pmt-int.

## NPV      

Net Present Value (NPV) =
Total PV of future CF’s - Initial Investment     
  * Accept Criteria if NPV > 0, NO otherwise.     

## The Payback Period Method     

Payback Period = number of years to recover initial costs;     

Rule: Accept the project if payback period is shorter than cutoff date;     

## The Discounted Payback Period Method     

Accept the project if it pays back on a discounted basis within the specified time.(not use that much)     

|  |  | @10% | Cumulative
|---|---|---|---|
|initial cost| \$(10,000) | \$(10,000)| \$(10,000)|
|Year 1 | 1,000 | 909.09 |(9,909.91)
|Year 2 | 4,000 |3,305.79|(5,785.12)
|Year 3 | 5,000 |3,756.57|(2,028.55)
|Year 4 | 6,000 |4,098.08|2,069.53

Do not take this project if the cutoff is 3 year.      

## The Internal Rate of Return(IRR Rule)     
IRR: the discount rate that sets NPV to zero      

Accept the project if the IRR is greater than the required return(hurdle) rate     

### Problems with the IRR Approach, **NPV is right**     

Using IRR fail to select between mutually exclusive projects. IRR is breaking when multiple positive/negative cashflow involved.     

* Scaling Problem: higher return with small limit of investment.     
   * IRR 100% profit on maximum \$1 invested, or IRR 50% profit on maximum \$100,000 investment.     

   * Choose the second project but not the higher IRR.     

* Timing Problem: front/back loaded     
   * same investment with larger payment in different time points, the difference will be discounted.      

   * Find NPV(A-B)=0, this is Crossover rate.     


## Profitability Index(PI)     

$PI=\frac{Total~PV~of~Future~Cash~Flow}{initial~~investment}$, Accept if PY>1, select highest PI.     

Meaning for every dollar invested, the future profit is greater than \$1.
